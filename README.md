# day-night
This is the project of computer graphics. here you can view the day and night of my simple small house.
during day you can see the blue sky where birds and plane are flying .
my house is surrounded by triangle shaped tree(we can also call christmass tree).
during night the sky is covered by twinkling stars.
you can see a moving star also.
this is our simple graphics project. how is it :D ?
